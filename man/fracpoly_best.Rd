\title{Best-fitting fractional polynomial}
\usage{
fracpoly_best(coef, coef_se, xmean, d = 1, pd = 0.05, method = "FE")
}
\arguments{
\item{coef}{coefficients of the localised average causal effects.}

\item{coef_se}{standard errors of the localised average causal effects.}

\item{xmean}{the mean of the exposure in each quantile.}

\item{d}{fractional polynomial degree. The default is degree 1. The other options are: 1, 2, or "both".}

\item{pd}{p-value cut-off for choosing the best-fitting fractional polynomial of degree 2 over the best-fitting fractional polynomial degree 1. This option is only used if d="both". The default is 0.05.}

\item{method}{the meta-analysis method.}
}
